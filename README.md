## read me!

Hello, my name is Jacob!  
I am 18 years old and currently studying **Cyber Security and Digital Forensics** at **Leeds Beckett University**
~
Prior to studying at Leeds Beckett, I had little coding experience, so please bear with me!  
Recently, I’ve developed an interest in programming and IT.
~
This interest has been influenced by my father, who is a **game developer and programmer**
